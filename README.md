## Copying
This library is designed to be very lightweight, but many people prefer not to
introduce new dependencies into their project if they can help it, especially if
the functionality provided is small.

To help reduce friction in such cases as adding this as a dependency would be an
issue, the code is released under an MIT-0 license, which means you can copy all
or part of the code without attribution and without reproducing the license
text, and even to relicense the code as a part of your own project without
restriction.
